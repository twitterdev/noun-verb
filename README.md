# Noun/Verb Twitter Bot Example

A [remixable Glitch example](https://noun-verb-bot.glitch.me/) that powers [@noun_verb](https://twitter.com/noun__verb).

## Prerequisites

In order to remix this code sample you will need the following:

- A developer account.
  - If you don’t already have access to the Twitter API, [you can sign up for a developer account.](http://t.co/signup)
- A Project in the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
- An App containing the credentials required to use the Twitter API
- OAuth 2.0 turned on in your App’s authentication settings
- You will also need to update your `.env` file to include your client ID, client secret and redirect URI. You can obtain your client ID and secret from your App's authentication settings and your redirect URI should be `your-glitch-project.glitch.me/oauth/callback`. This must match the redirect URI in your App's authentication settings.
- This application is [boosted using Glitch's pro plan](https://glitch.com/pricing?utm_medium=weblink&utm_source=dev.to&utm_campaign=blog&utm_content=dev)


## Making this bot your own

You may want to change the logic of your bot so that it Tweets something different than Noun/Verb pairings. You can also change the timing to run on a interval as well.
